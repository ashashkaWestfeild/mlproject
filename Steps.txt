Creating venv(environment) python 3.8 => working on specific version
updated SSH key => verifying git 
created .gitignore file => A .gitignore file is a text file used by the version control system Git to specify 
    files and directories that should be ignored and not tracked by Git. 
    By using a .gitignore file, you can prevent accidental commits of unnecessary or sensitive files, keeping your 
    repository clean and focused on the files that are relevant to your project.
created setup.py => setup.py will help us to build our entire ML application as a package and even deploy in pypi
created requirements.txt => will have all the package we will need to install while implementing the project
src => source| __init__.py
-e . in requirements.txt will automatically trigger setup.py

create components folder in src, 
    It will have __init__.py so that it can be created as a package and later can be imported
*COMPONENTS WILL HAVE => All the modules OR necessary steps to CREATE a model
create data_ingestion.py in components => This will have all the code that will help to read the data
    This file can also contain code for 80:20 split
create data_transformation.py in components => This will have all the code regarding data transformation
create model_trainer.py in components => This will have all the code of creating a model
    This file can also contain code for confusion matrix or Adj. R squarred code
# We can still add model_evaluation.py, data_validation.py, etc in components
create pipeline folder in src => create __init__.py, so that we can import this
    Create train_pipeline.py and predict_pipeline.py
create logger.py in src => for logging
create exception.py in src => for exception handling purpose
create utils.py in src => will contain all the functionalities which can be used in entire application
    e.g. code for mongodb client or the code for saving the model to cloud

Now, start with exception handling in python by imorting sys,
    This code will remain same for all our projects
# The python sys module provides functions and variables which are used to manipulate different parts of the Python Runtime Environment.
# So any exception that is basically getting control, the sys library will automatically willhave that information
# Exception handling is a programming concept and a mechanism used to handle and manage errors or exceptional conditions that may occur during the execution of a program. 
# It is not a specific code or function itself, but rather a set of techniques and constructs used to handle and respond to exceptions or errors gracefully.

Now, logger.py
# The purpose of a logger.py file is to provide a logging system that allows developers to record and manage log messages during the execution of a program.
# Logging is a crucial part of software development as it helps in tracking program execution, troubleshooting issues, and monitoring the behavior of an application. 
# The logger.py file usually contains code that sets up a logger object, configures its behavior, and defines how log messages should be handled and formatted.
